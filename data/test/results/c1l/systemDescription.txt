System: WSD2
Configuration: c1l
Team: lst-ru  (Maarten van Gompel)
Submission Name: WSD2-c1l
System source: http://github.com/proycon/wsd2

Approach:
----------

WSD2 system using a k-NN classifier approach using timbl (IB1). This configuration uses 1 context feature both left and right, a focus word feature, and with added lemma features for both context and focus. Parameters have been optimised on the trial data using paramsearch.


Resources and tools used:

 - Timbl for Machine learning (http://ilk.uvt.nl/timbl)
 - paramsearch for parameter optimisation (http://ilk.uvt.nl/paramsearch)
 - python-timbl (https://github.com/proycon/python-timbl)
 - pynlpl (https://github.com/proycon/pynlpl)
 - Ucto for tokenisation of all languages (http://ilk.uvt.nl/ucto)
 - Frog for PoS-tagging and Lemmatisation of Dutch (http://ilk.uvt.nl/frog)
